        <p class="lead mb-4">I tutored students with low-incomes in Santa Ana for Educators at Orange County. I provided and uploaded sources for students to view on YouTube. I organized meetings, fundraisers, and tutoring schedules for teachers and their students. I took notes during meetings and uploaded pictures onto their website. I also overlook all operations on the executive board. I also worked as a social media paid position at their software development company. I worked along with UX/UI designers to help them optimize website functionality so customers or any consumer base is able to easily access and use it. I also helped the sales team to display programs so people could see a variety of programs that were being held during the summer and throughout the school year.

        I was a teacher at a Korean school and my job was to make sure that the kids were always participating in classroom activities and focusing throughout the lesson. Teaching them Korean was the most important part of my priorities as a teacher but also making every class fun. Every Sunday, I helped students to engage in learning and assignments. I also got to privately tutor a student because they were planning on transferring to Korea, so a lot more work was put into that student. The basics were taught, such as grammar, vocabulary, reading, and anything else that would help him improve his Korean skills. I assigned homework to all my students every week so that they can also practice at home and come back the next week ready to learn something new.

        I was an assistant intern, record keeper, and was in charge of data collection on animal treatment and procedures at VolunTeen at the Aquarium of the Pacific. I treated injured animals, fed medication to baby otters, sharks, and penguins. This program educated interns on marine life, introduced me to scientists and researchers, and exposed me to research and the scientific method.
